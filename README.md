# QuickBooks API Authentication w Rails

A little tutorial companion for using the QB API with Ruby on Rails.

## Setup
Prior to running this app, copy config/env.yml.sample to config/env.yml and add your own secrets here. See this article on [the big picture of how to create a QB API application](http://nurelm.com/quickbooks-api-integration-1-the-basics/) and this one on [how to use OAuth with QuickBooks applications](http://nurelm.com/quickbooks-api-integration-2-the-horrors-of-oauth/) for more on what the QB_CONSUMER_KEY and QB_CONSUMER_SECRET variables mean.

## Current State
So far only goes through the OAuth authentication process.
